# Introduction
Here you will find the design and development of a DIY turbojet engine.
Feel free to participate and ask me anything about the project.

I started this project even before being trained on many of the topics covered. Through this project I was able to develop my skills on a wide range of engineering. Mechanical, Design, Metalworking, Fluid mechanics, Chemistry, Electronics, programming, Organization.

# V1

The first objective of this project is to produce a functional miniature turbojet engine. That is to say, which is self-sustaining

## A bit of theory

![Image theory](images/theory.png){style="align: center"}

The turbojet transforms the chemical energy of a fuel into kinetic energy. The thrust created by the turbojet comes from the acceleration of a quantity of air between the inlet and the outlet of the system.

To do this, we entered the system with a compressor that allows us to inject a sufficient quantity of air. Then a large amount of energy is released by the combustion of a fuel with the air sent by the compressor. Part of the energy is recovered by a turbine at the system output which will drive the input compressor. The other part of the energy produces the thrust by expansion in the nozzle.

Thanks to the compressor / turbine system, the air flow is self-sustaining. It's our goal
